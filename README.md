#Installation 
The requirements for running LaptopDatabase is Python 3.7 and the following:

et-xmlfile==1.0.1
jdcal==1.4.1
numpy==1.17.4
openpyxl==3.0.2

Python can be downloaded at the following link on Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/ If you are running Linux or Mac OS, Python should be pre installed, just ensure to upgrade Python to the latest version.


Pandas can be installed with pip or your favorite package manager:
	Pip install pandas

The rest are dependencies and sub dependencies from the following packages:
	Pip install openpyxl
	Pip install xlrd
		
After installing those, you should be good to go to run Laptop Database. These are required for manipulating an excel spreadsheet. Once these dependencies and Python3.7 are installed, the only thing that is required to do to get Laptop Database up and running is to extract it to a folder and then run LaptopDatabaseMain in that location in terminal.

#How To Use Laptop Database
To use the program, first you buy laptops to add them to the database. Enter the attributes of the laptop, and then when you are done the laptop is going to be added to the database.
After you are done buying laptops, you can use the view command to view analytics or make queries of the laptops in the database, and sort them by different attributes such as name, manufacturer, model, etc.
Once you are done viewing what you have bought, you can sell using the sell menu from the main menu. To do this, type 'sell' into the main menu, and it will provide a list of serial numbers in the database. When you want to sell one, please enter its respective serial number and it will be sold.
You can then view sold items in the view menu as well.
